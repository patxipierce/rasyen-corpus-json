# RaSyEn Corpus JSON

Is a collection of (for now) fantasy themed strings for use in the creation of randomly created content.

The content itself is separated by topic, and avoids using RPG language (eg. "1d4 x level fire damage") so it can be used accross fantasy RPG settings.

A lot of the content is always under constant review, re-classification, renewal, so you can expect changes at any time.

You can download the set and help make it better at [https://code.patxipierce.com/rasyen-corpus/](https://code.patxipierce.com/rasyen-corpus/).
