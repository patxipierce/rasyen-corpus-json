# RaSyEn Corpus JSON

Is a collection of (for now) fantasy themed strings for use in the creation of randomly created content.

The content itself is separated by topic, and avoids using RPG language (eg. "1d4 x level fire damage") so it can be used accross fantasy RPG settings.

A lot of the content is always under constant review, re-classification, renewal, so you can expect changes at any time.

If you see something out of order or have comments about the content please rise an issue [here](https://github.com/patxipierce/rasyen-corpus-json/issues/new).
